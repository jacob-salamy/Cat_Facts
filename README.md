# Cat Facts

This script scrapes https://www.factretriever.com/cat-facts and emails a random fact to your recipient of choice. Just fill out the address line below and the script will send the cat fact through catfacts.1921@gmail.com.

One particularly devious usage of this script is in combination with cronR. This RStudio addin allows you to schedule scripts to run at set intervals. See https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cronR/index.html for more information.
